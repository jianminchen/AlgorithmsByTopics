Let me document how long it takes me to get ready for the algorithm called infix expression to binary expression tree.

30 minutes to write a brute force solutin without implementation of parser, I did not have time to write code for parser. 
Time complexity is O(N^2). The parse of the expression is too complicated to write

July 19 - July 20, 2018

Study binary expression tree, and also read the article and code to conver infix expression to postfix expression etc. 

Blogs related to study are the following:
